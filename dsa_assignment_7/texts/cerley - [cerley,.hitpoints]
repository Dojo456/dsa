it's funny cause we usually put the meetings on google calendar and send invites. 
as a funny little poke at business scool students. 
no ok wait this is embarrassing. 
i actually live on gcal now. 
like. 
google calendar invites are required to meet with me. 
not even kidding it'll help. 
. 
this is just a my school weird culture thing. 
they occur at the same time. 
no some of it are classes. 
classes and office hours line up. 
or different events line up. 
there are some people who have like. 
showering on gcal. 
green. 
oh yeah the colon event was made by someone else. 
and the dash was made by me. 
yea i should kill them for that. 
get ratioed idiot. 
you joke?. 
stop talking. 
uh-. 
?. 
you dont know what that word means. 
id like to see you try. 
come to boston then. 
you think. 
epee fencer 🤮 i. 
everyone fences foil. 
why did you choose eppe. 
foil is the most popular by far. 
what that's bullshit. 
2 years is such a long time. 
effectively. 
yeah saber is weird. 
idk foil is really back and forth and i like that. 
it's really just. 
reaction tho. 
you play celeste you absolutley couldve fenced foil. 
nope. 
they are fast and i am bad at it. 
no but like. 
celeste is. 
like you dont really think about the keys your pressing right. 
i woudl assume. 
same thing in foil. 
like you just react to. 
oh i felt a hit on my blade so im ust hit back. 
yeah that's true. 
ig you do get just run into them. 
slacking. 
yeah wait you are not the most advantaged at epee. 
get surgery. 
i mean do it for fun. 
crunc. 
h. 
not but. 
distance management matters a lot in foil. 
so. 
being short is less of a disadvantage. 
like epee reach matters soooo much. 
you started with pistol D:. 
really you cant start french. 
in epee?. 
i mean everyone uses pistol in foil so. 
oh i see i see. 
what. 
people use french a lot. 
crazy how the extra like inch matters that much. 
yeah. 
and you have way less control. 
ok how about. 
russian grip. 
it's a blocky pistol. 
huh. 
oh i see i see. 
we will fence soem time. 
foil vs epee and we are blind. 
WAIT YES. 
ok yes. 
really. 
what. 
you have lke. 
worse vision than me. 
i think so. 
im like. 
-1. 
oh. 
ok. 
but short sightedness makes your reactions slower. 
yes. 
cause. 
it takes your brain longer to like. 
process he image. 
yeah :D. 
i did not fence with glasses. 
mainly because i did not wear glasses then. 
i was simply blind. 
why didnt you just. 
wear our glasses. 
oh!. 
and. 
walking is easier?. 
waling to the board is easier?. 
oh.

DND planning.

Couldn't they like. 
Play online. 
Business what?. 
:(. 
Yeah that's true huh.

Anyways. 
And use republic transit. 
Oh. 
Then it works perfectly no. 
Fair. 
Hmm. 
Ok maybe I am a business major but actually use when 2meer so useful. 
Well it's not like you don't want them there it's just or actually doesn't work out.

It was a laser show with dark side of the moon playing. 
AND. 
It was at the Boston museum of science. 
In the planetarium. 
Which is just a giant circular theater and the screen is the fucking roof. 
And all the seat are super reclined so you're looking at the ceiling. 
But idk if youve heard that album but it's basically just almosr pyschedlic music with a bunch of sax and elec guitar solos. 
And with lasers. 
IT WAS SO FUCKING COOL. 
Just. 
Immersed in music with crazu lights on the roof. 
It was so much fun. 
Come to Boston I'll take you :(. 
I am not. 
I ended up going with like 4 people to the light show which is too many to car camp :(.

it keeps rotating in my head. 
yk. 
something im curios about is how animators collaborate. 
like. 
it doesnt really make sense to me. 
like. 
how do they make sure all the animators are able to draw with the same style. 
and look consistent. 
interesting so youd really have to learn how to draw with another style really well. 
huh. 
that is insanely impressive. 
reading show bible now. 
hi!. 
ok see i can tell they are different styles but i couldnte tell you what about each makes them different. 
i am so bored D:.

(we just call it that). 
(it's just chatting with a friend). 
and i had one class but i skipped it because it is a fully useless class and our professor doesnt teach at all. 
ofc :). 
he literally posts all the lectures of another prof on his canvas page. 
and i was aving a 1-1 with my friend and i was like i am just not going to go. 
so i didnt. 
and then i had an event for rush as well.

god what a crazy title. 
great name tho!. 
ok scrolling so i can judge you more. 
hm there is nothing to judge you on. 
but since we have 91% match.... 
:). 
ill take it ig. 
god harvey is such a good song. 
i have not listened to it in so long. 
it's such perfect beach trip vibes. 
(holy shit i should change my name to harvey). 
ok super random. 
i want like an. 
alter ego name. 
if that makes any sense. 
honestly cant. 
like not online. 
irl. 
my idea was to show up at a party with a character in mind walk around grace people with my presence and leave. 
yk. 
but i want to do that while acting as a different persona. 
yes.. 
(refuses to elaborate). 
what are you saying :/. 
ig im literally middle school hailey or something. 
mmm but yeah i do have a whole character in mind. 
i will admit a little embarassing to describe so i will not :). 
renee. 
no way you knew it what. 
NO WAY YOU REMEMBER THAT. 
???. 
I DONT EVEN REMEMBER SAYING THAT. 
interesting. 
thats your online name right. 
is there like a persona behind it or not really. 
lee pham. 
hm yeah. 
ig it is a bit of a middle school thing. 
i also think danile is just a very generic name. 
it would be fun to have a name that stands out a lot. 
like i know someone who's name monet. 
literally know nothing about them. 
but just because of that name they already seem like the coolest fucking person. 
also. 
would you be interested in doing animations for a song?. 
like. 
animated music videos. 
you used to be obsessed with harvey. 
i always used to see you listening to it. 
ok ok. 
i will keep that in mind. 
except the screen i have most of the mini pc set up. 
and for my first project with it. 
im thinking of just essentially playing fool on cool on it. 
like it starts zoomed out with the tv in screen and the intro starts playing. 
and then it transitions to just the music video. 
like a mv remix if that makes sense?. 
but anyways yes i will keep you posted on it (idk if you want to but i will anyways). 
how was your day. 
man i want to listen to the blend but harvey is just so fucking good. 
random but yesterday i had one class and i skipped it. 
i need to drop out of this college bullshit. 
video james!. 
hope james is ok. 
v good. 
such a long day tho omg. 
woke up at 7:30 and i had stuff like back to back to back to back to front until like two hours ago. 
i am so tired. 
honestly impressed how i havent passed out yet. 
took an accounting quiz and i think i did good. 
i also got sheet metal trained today!. 
i can sheet metal now!. 
it's a machine shop training. 
so to cut and to work with sheet metal you need separate training than like metal blocks because very thin metal has weird behavior. 
for some reason. 
essentially. 
instead of treating it like metal you treat it like paper and you use like hole punches and make folds. 
instead of drills and saws. 
(praying for james). 
(god knows he's innocent). 
wait i have a favor to ask :D. 
could you like. 
send me the animations you sent me before. 
i know there's eve but there's a few others that i dont remmeer the names too and ive been trying to find them. 
i need to pick one for the mini c. 
fool on cool is good but the ending is kinda hard to transition. 
(im a strong james supporter ill die for them). 
idk if all. 
but like. 
i your opinion. 
which ones would look cool on an old crt. 
or fit's that vibe. 
which conert. 
ok last summer is really good. 
i feel like sad / chill mv would work better. 
or coming back summer or another break?. 
5/5 classes end. 
wait that's so early. 
yeah 5/5 last exam :D. 
ok i also started like. 
jan 17. 
wtf where is my money going where are the classes. 
love this place!!!. 
ok fine ig ill go to a concert with you or whatever. 
:/. 
we do need to go to more concerts. 
at cavetown i didnt even know you that well. 
yes that's what im saying. 
now itll be even more fun. 
come to boston please come to samia with me :(. 
this firday. 
LMAO. 
ok fair jury duty is important to keeping this country running. 
you keep saying that but ive seen you a total of 0 times this semester what's up with that?. 
yk i did but the optomotirst (how the fuck do i spell that) started screaming and melted into the floor when they looked into my eyes. 
what's up with that?. 
god youre right. 
im starting to forget what the word gaslighting means too!. 
LOVE icarus. 
?.

man thinking about hs actually makes me sad. 
i miss seeing everyone. 
even people who i dont really care about that much. 
like. 
the fact that ill probably never really talk to a lot of them again makes me sad. 
:/.

wait i discovered a new emoticon.

RIP he was a real one if only he wasnt british. 
we go back as alumni but we just go to every class. 
(he told me it's terminal D:).

OK THAT MAKSE ME SO SAD. 
:(. 
wtf. 
why must time pass in a linear fashion. 
clock. 
or diagonal. 
like so. 
. 
well im illiterate so that must be why im always late to class. 
but really intersting. 
i wonder if clocks do that too. 
like. 
with languages that flow right to left is our counterclockwise their clockwise?. 
Right but. 
Do the hands go the other direction. 
Because we are reading a clock numbers left to right. 
Terrible fucking response die. 
Ok but. 
Starting off. 
I feel like the starting direction is more important. 
Wait I just had the best idea. 
Oh I cannot tell you tho. 
Ok you can know nvm I've come to my senses. 
I know exactly what should be on the kinipc. 
Harvey playing.

but. 
i still have not figured out my moveout stituation. 
not having a car is a pain. 
Go do your work >:(. 
Hi. 
. 
Shrimp is so integral to your character. 
ya!. 
so fun story. 
the exam was on canvas right. 
and on canvas, the due date is 12:30. 
my dumbass thought that that meant the exam **started** at 12:30. 
but thank god!. 
i woke up at 10:20. 
to text my friend and ask her where the exam was. 
(i didnt know that either). 
and she sent me her calendar event of the exam. 
and turns out. 
it **ends** at 12:30, and starts at 10:30!. 
so i like got dressed and ran to the exam center in like 7 mins and managed to get there on time. 
truly what a day. 
ya :D. 
there was soooo little stopping me from fully missing that exam. 
woooO!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 
yeah. 
do you think i shoudlve missed it. 
objectively it wouldve been funnier. 
plans now?. 
oh youre doing commissions again? :o. 
im trying to learn godot. 
i know!. 
might need help from you. 
is this for the staffs?. 
Meow!. 
The cat looks like a vase. 
Just fucking around for now. 
No main thing I thought of was. 
I was playing don’t starve. 
And there’s like random birds and stuff that spawns right. 
And for me they help a lot in making the game feel less isolating and lonely. 
And a lot of single player games don’t have those or is really devoid of people except you and the interactable NPCs. 
At least the games I’m thinking of. 
So. 
I was just gonna mess around with environments and see how they feel. 
And kinda why. 
No I hate you sorry. 
Sorry I don’t make the rules :(. 
Kidding!. 
We should starve together. 
I’ve only played for 4 nights so. 
We can just play this world together. 
Survival games are fun I’ve missed them. 
Like real food survival. 
Don’t starve together. 
I got the first one and then realized the second one is even cheaper so I bought that. 
It was 1.49 kinda insane. 
But I’m a big lost tbh. 
Ok. 
I must sleep. 
We will game. 
As soon as I’m done with finals. 
Which is. 
Day after tomorrow!. 
Grom!. 
Gn!. 
Missed them all. 
Willingly. 
Currently sewing. 
:). 
youll never know. 
there were some rips in my jackets. 
so i needed to sew them. 
but i decided to sew tem in a different color than the jacket. 
which. 
turned out ok. 
well i only did for one. 
but i think ill embroider over it to look like an actual stitch. 
like. 
medical stitch. 
also i have been listening to the charlie brown soundtrack obsessively. 
literally no idea. 
my friend reccomended it. 
and it's just lke. 
so soothing in all the right ways. 
helps me focus so well. 
pretty good. 
cant complain really. 
uh. 
i didnt have time to double check my accounting exam but. 
i think it was good enough. 
anyways yeah. 
but. 
i am stressed about moving out. 
now that exams are done. 
i was so sick this weekend so i barely planned for anything. 
this saturday. 
so i have some time. 
charms!!!. 
show me some. 
also have you ever seen evangelion. 
Packing all day today!. 
Thank thank you you I’m going to need it.

except my bike. 
so. 
i am staying at my friends dorm for an extra night. 
and tomorrow i will be biking my bike to where i live. 
but yeah im basically done!!!!. 
so fucking happy to be done. 
this has been causing me such a headache for the past like three days.

sorry i have been so busy. 
that looks very cute. 
i will play!. 
also. 
i have finally moved in.

So so so good. 
I was so stressed about it. 
It was okay. 
Still a good amount of work but. 
Got it. 
But. 
Forgot my bed sheets so. 
Well. 
P. 
Yes yes we should. 
I just need like. 
2 more days to settle in and stuff. 
Gah. 
I am so busy. 
But. 
I have started watching evangelion. 
Actually so good. 
I like barely watch anime but. 
This is good. 
I think it might be eep time for me :D. 
I’ve been awake since so early. 
Gn!. 
Sorry I have been so busy. 
Bike was stolen. 
Love the city. 
Yeah I did not get it back. 
Welp. 
Kinda needed that bike too. 
To get around. 
Whatever ig. 
Also. 
How busy are you during the day. 
I doubt I’ll be able to game at night. 
oh?. 
where are you going. 
wtf D:. 
what were your plans. 
and what happened. 
wtf D:. 
they both cancelled. 
oh wait no. 
but. 
man. 
triston can join in virtually or smthing. 
i have not. 
what is that. 
is that. 
just three guns. 
there is a steampunk festival this weekend im trying to go to but. 
i need outfit ideas D:. 
should i bring a cog. 
ok will do my best with that one. 
but yes!. 
very excited. 
althoug. 
never been to anything like this before. 
and are you watching trigun. 
you watched. 
all 12. 
last night. 
im excited im so bored in boston i have no idea what to do. 
and oh?. 
tell me abotu it. 
what is so cool. 
Interesting that first one doesn’t look 3d at all that’s so interesting. 
Interesting. 
Just from the shots they look. 
An interesting way to show 3d animation I feel like. 
Oh yah!. 
You didn’t like 3d right. 
And the movement thing is really interesting too cause I’ve been watching evangelion. 
And in that they make use of stills so much. 
For example there this one scene that’s kinda famous and it’s two characters that don’t like each other and they’re in an elevator for 52 seconds straight. 
Wait eating dinner. 
Will finish thought!. 
back. 
long long dinner. 
and animation in genearl has become so much more unique i feel like. 
like. 
past 2 years. 
so many actually good animated movies where the style is unique. 
or not movies specifically just media ig and kinda importantly this media has actually been very mainstream and popular. 
Very enjoyed. 
It’s a great medium I think not many other mediums are so versatile and also has room for style expression. 
I’ve been messing with Godot and. 
Makes me really want to learn digital art. 
MET DOG TODAY. 
. 
His name is taiga and he napped on my leg. 
RIGJT. 
He’s so cute it should be illegal :(. 
I’m about to watch this movie called Suzume. 
You might’ve heard it. 
it's this anime movie and like. 
i think it's pretty famous sort of. 
its a small anime movie from japan that is showing in american theaters so. 
BUT IT WAS SOOOOOO GOOD.

Slowly getting more and more time. 
I got a haircut though!. 
Friend was really drunk and thought it’d be funny to cut my hair and I was like sure and it turned out really well. 
:). 
. 
RIGHT. 
And like. 
At one point. 
She asked me how to hold scissors cause she wasn’t sure if she was doing it correctly. 
But yeah wild I was fully sober and allowed this. 
Is that. 
Is that sasuke. 
And is this. 
In response to the last photo. 
Well. 
Yk how craft scissors sometimes have like. 
One bigger hole and one smaller one. 
She wasn’t sure which fingers went where. 
I’m literally sasuke.

Wait I’m so tempted to stay here another few days to go to that. 
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT. 
This just flipped my entire plans I think. 
I was going to come back early. 
On the 25th but. 
My lease is until the last day of the month so. 
I could. 
Just stay an extra night at a friends house. 
And go to backseat lovers. 
And come back a little later. 
And backseat lovers would probably not go on tour for like a *rally long time* so. 
This is kind of a one time opportunity. 
Oh nvm. 
They are sold out. 
I speak what I think I’m not afraid. 
Well. 
Ig I am coming back 25th. 
Ok. 
I must sleep. 
Slept way too late yesterday. 
Gn!. 
How is that possible D:. 
Wtf. 
That’s no fair I’m listening to khaki dreams rn :(. 
They’re on tour rn?. 
WTF WTF WTF. 
I’m sure they will grow a sudden love for Florida and perform at UF too?. 
Ok tbf I think I’ve spoken to Myra like. 
Thrice. 
Well. 
Ok yk what Orlando does have going for it tho. 
Yk SALES. 
They are based in Orlando. 
Except they never play live :(. 
You should come visit Boston. 
This city is so nice. 
If you have no plans tomorrow can you come. 
Wtf you’d go to Atlanta but not Boston :(. 
You hate me.

Do you remember the glass flowers scene from tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow.

Ya it’s actually insane. 
They look exactly like real plants.

. 
Oh um. 
In that case. 
Ya maybe :(. 
NOOOOOOOO. 
AN ANELMONE. 
I saw a menu with the item shrimp toast the other day and in my head I automatically thought it was like a verb. 
Like you pay some money for a shrimp to toast to you. 
Idk Harvard is really cruel sometimes :(. 
And not a single block of ivy for me to climb on on campus. 
False advertisement.

sigh i would like to wear more elaborate piercings. 
like your chain earring its so cool!. 
alas. 
ok i will wear the lollipops but i can only wear one. 
which kind of. 
throws it off a little. 
ok ok ill take your word for it. 
ok but if they were asymmetrical bu tmatching that would be kinda sick. 
like a heart lollipop and a heart piercing. 
maybe i should take a step further. 
maybe i should get a face tat. 
like a tear. 
thoughts?. 
yes i will tattoo those exact words on my forehead. 
"something about murder". 
but i should get my ear repierced it is so annoying to wear one. 
ok.

yes.. 
cat cafe.. 
meow.. 
uh i have started working again so i am kinda busy during the mornings and early afternoon but. 
after that i can go. 
what are you doing monday. 
ok i also sleep immediately after i get off of work for 15 hours straight and wake no breakfast no lunch no dinner no food no water just work. 
ok how aboutc. 
afe cafe at 5. 
we need to make a reservation. 
. 
we're the cool cats now. 
wait isnt this your first time at a cat cafe too :D. 
also. 
baked cookies today with carson. 
they turned out. 
funny. 
wait i don thave photos. 
let me find hotos. 
well!!!. 
a lot of ways actually. 
first. 
we bought box mix. 
well actually first first we didnt have a baking sheet so i brought this like round pizza baking thing. 
(its a baking sheet but round). 
we joked that we would make One Big Cookie but we thought best not to. 
ok carson has the photos i need to ask him. 
MANY things went wrong. 
i will die monday morning mark my words. 
you will **never** go to a cat cafe. 
ok but i die so neither of us are winning really. 
the cats are really cute. 
they reallly really really like to lay in the sun. 
meow. 
OK I CANT FIND PHTOS BUT. 
the cookies turned out like. 
One Big Cookie. 
but not intentionally!. 
first. 
we decided to add one extra egg because like. 
one extra egg cant hurt right. 
it hurt. 
AND THEN. 
we burnt it. 
like. 
the dough seemed not wet enough. 
yk. 
baking is very much a feel thing. 
:). 
(to box mix too which specified *the exact amount* of each ingredient). 
BUT. 
IT WAS FINE BECAUSE. 
we burnt it too :). 
AND. 
when you add too much egg to cookie dough it becomes softer and kinda chewy but being burnt offset that and they had almost(?) normal texture. 
the bottom was crispy™️ but like the middle was sort of ok?. 
no. 
it would be less funny. 
the end cookies tasted good tho!. 
we also didnt have a bowl to mix stuff so we mixed it all in a pot and then put the pot over the stove just to see what would happen. 
turns out cookie dough with extra egg over low heat kinda turns into pancakey type thing. 
except the bottom of the pancake was burnt BUT OTHER THAN THAT the texture was exactly like a pancake. 
im SOOOO good at this. 
dont worry i gotchu. 
*I* will bake the cake. 
you can just sit back and watch the master do it. 
but yeah the goal was to bake some cookies and pass them around his dorm because today is move in day and he wanted ot meet his new hallmates but we couldnt give out the fuckign joined together cookies. 
ok still waiting on the photo but the end result, the cookies kinda looked like cells under a microscope. 
shape wise at least. 
maybe your premade cookies sucked. 
why no friends D:. 
well if they were so great then. 
what is an llc. 
live laugh (c)love?. 
unfortunate. 
that llc missed out they couldve made cool new friends outside of their community. 
. 
the stookie. 
thoughts?. 
truly psychic blasted. 
(psychic blast!). 
BUT THEY WERE GOOD. 
i mightve unlocked a secret new recipe. 
pancakes in a pinch. 
i will call them. 
we should bake together some time!!!!. 
no itll be so much fun!!!. 
the end result will be horrible but. 
its the journey that matters amen. 
your record will be fine. 
look. 
if your worried. 
ill take *all* the blame for the failed result. 
or you probably dont want to bake with me because you hate me nvm. 
sigh you do. 
we should bake. 
so many activities to do. 
i am horrible at planning too nothing will happen ever :D. 
ok kinda related. 
something i really really wnatd to do this summer was to pick blueberries and then on the same day bake a blueberry pie but. 
apparently its not blueberry season. 
its a spring crop so. 
guess ill never be able to bake again. 
And how many times have I been on time :). 
Ok it is sleep time for me. 
Good night!. 
You will stay up for 2 more hours probably. 
hi. 
how are you. 
You say every single movie every made all in one day??. 
Wow that is amazing. 
What movie did you watch tho. 
The first one?. 
I am on the verge of death. 
But. 
Good day other than that!. 
Went go karting actually. 
I was born to be a racist. 
LIKE MARIO. 
THE GUY. 
EHO OWNS THE PLACE. 
IS CALLED MARIO ANDRETTI. 
AND THE TRACK FOR KIDS WAS CALLED MARIO KARTS. 
Omg I must’ve been in the movie you watched. 
Ok next time you go I’ll be the kart. 
I was the kart. 
Fuck you.. 
Sorry I don’t mean it :(. 
Also started new book which matches with my bag. 
. 
Wahhh. 
(Am I doing it right). 
Thanks I got it at the Eric Carle museum in Boston!. 
Well I listen to the audiobook every night before I sleep does that count. 
(It keeps the scary monsters away). 
It was actually really cool it was like a museum of a bunch of children’s book and they have this section where it’s all the books in many different languages including like rarer dying languages. 
Children’s books translation is apparently a huge thing for language revival. 
RIGHT. 
OK SO COME VISIT ME IN BOSTON SO WE CAN GO. 
Should I find you a copy of the very hungry caterpillar in viet. 
SHE FORGOT. 
Ok but can I spoil the plot for you I really like this book. 
That is tragic. 
I don’t even know any Chinese nursery rhymes sigh. 
The caterpillar eats **a lot**. The End.. 
Honestly I don’t remember how the book goes. 
Like just.

You would watch adventure time through YouTube clips. 
Oh I’m very sorry.

Also I didn’t ask yesterday but why are you so tired all the time D:. 
Maybe sleeping so late doesn’t help :(.

Hi. 
Sorry busy weekend. 
And I’m. 
Um. 
Idk. 
I went to Millenia and there was nothing but clothes stores. 
Can’t really say why but it just annoyed me. 
I think malls are just like the perfect example of mass consumerism and like culture being formed by corporatioms?. 
Sigh. 
Where’s our emo band when we need them? 💔. 
Noooooo! Don’t do it they have a family. 
Think about all the children. 
You would believe in that you capitalist consumer pig. 
But what did unity ever do :(. 
Add a cool painting in that direction so it’s a feature :c. 
OR. 
Make him a horse and add the sea. 
Ok uh don’t have to make fun of my vision like uncalled for?. 
Ok film it please. 
Ok but you can film yourself writing stupid code and giggling over how stupid it is. 
Oh no you didn’t.

snapchat. 
eugh. 
i love the background becomes double too sometimes this looks really good.

i think it’s just too tedious of a game. 
like. 
so much to do not enough time. 
and there’s this other game. 
astroneer. 
i’ve shown you i think. 
and in this game you can like automate everything so you can have auto trains that mine for you and stuff that plants for you and. 
idk stardew aesthetics but it’s like a factory sim game like factorial would be cool. 
but with old town tech like minecarts and sprinklers. 
also i have something for you. 
it’s a surprise :). 
hi. 
you have changed your discord username. 
?.

SUCH GOOD FRIENDS WITH EACH OTHER.

kel. 
:). 
who is your aubrey. 
oleyar.

oh wait your right yes.

AND HIS NAME IS BASIL. 
ya i think so too. 
i love hero ill take that as a compiment. 
no actually. 
im boss. 
or the old sprout guy. 
ya more the old sprout guy. 
HERO IS NOT SASUKE WHAT. 
hero is so like. 
death.. 
i will beat you to death. 
but i cant believe you didnt see that. 
i see the three colors and instantly. 
neurons fire. 
who is tat. 
delete that. 
i. 
i dont think thats adam. 
mmm what color. 
hold on i need an idea of what this will lookl ike. 
like. 
dyed under part of hair. 
that is NOT adam sandler. 
OH. 
yes. 
red. 
actually the blonde looks really good rn. 
i have never seen any of these games. 
yume nikki is released in 2004. 
that game was released before you were born and there like 200 players how do you know about it. 
yk. 
id watch this. 
see adam sandler is always cast as like a goofy stupid guy but i think itd be funny to see him as **pure neutral** omori. 
THE 3D GRAPHICS. 
of the game. 
yumi nikki. 
lmao everything is flat except the character. 
idk i dont think he can do it it really takes a world class actor to pull it off. 
like chris pratt. 
no the graphics are just so early 2000s. 
koopa!. 
does. 
omori not talk. 
uh has he really not??. 
idk i havent really noticed. 
i think i have just filled in the dialogue for him in my head. 
like. 
i am him. 
silent and strong~. 
just like. 
... 
wtf is this engima code. 
is this loss. 
. 
what does this mean. 
i. 
you do. 
you know. 
hm. 
ok im trying to figure it out. 
maybe the first single period symbolizes the period of intense loneliness that he experienced after his family died. 
and then the a wit the period. 
symbolizes how he met squ(a)d 7 and that ended the period / sentence. 
and the is just his name ig. 
god ever time i type something i read it in the voice of sasuke because of my pfp it just looks like its him pondering and then uttering his learnings. 
yk. 
ive only seen naruto dubbed like twice but its so beamed into my head. 
playing omori and reading lotr makes me want to play mc again so bad but. 
i suck at that game :/. 
sigh i might. 
minecraft islike. 
so *almost* the perfect game for me. 
like. 
ok you will hate me for this but. 
i love the building aspect i love all the details and stuff but the game. 
its too ambient D:. 
if i play mc by myself its like kinda dull. 
ya i feel. 
that is unfrotunately a big reason i play mostly multiplayer games. 
omori would get ***rocked*** by the ender dragon. 
ya i know exactly which character is which too and its so fucking accurate. 
it just makes. 
no sense. 
stuff just keeps happening. 
hailow. 
hi. 
wtf i’m so sorry :(. 
he WOULD he isn’t nearly strong enough. 
.

same there are no games i am able to play right now that will be like that. 
are you still making your game. 
ok once college starts. 
if i was to start making a game. 
could i ask you for direction :D. 
also i think notion is the best song out of the bunch. 
well if you’d like i can do the difficult guitar part and you can do the fun singing part?. 
ok yipppeeee!!. 
wydm it. 
its not a joke?. 
i thought you loved singing. 
true!!! you are the world's #1 guitarist no one even comes close to you. 
and cool and strong too i agree. 
ok which song do you want tho. 
i think notion but. 
what do you think. 
ive actually never heard you play electric guitar could you play for me some time i really want to hear. 
floating vibes would be sick too i fucking love that song it’s one my favorites of all time. 
but i think. 
or devil town. 
throwback from cavetown. 
don’t care i’ll think it’s impressive and cool anyways :). 
you are spreading the omori gospel amen. 
what do they think so far. 
also havey ou read dune. 
have i ever talked toyou about dune. 
really have i actually never talked about it. 
it is my favorite book series by far. 
offline?. 
:). 
mmm. 
who are you hiding from. 
tell me tell me tell me :(. 
also this is a like a four page response. 
reason i asked is i also really really want to make a game based on dune. 
every dune game so far has been like a strategy world building game which imo really sucks and misses the point of the book. 
your always like. 
shaping the environment or building up stuff to make your civilizatoin stronger but. 
a big theme of the book is to utlize your environment and cultuer and lifestyle is shaped by environment. 
so shape the environment to better benefit you instead of fightring against it. 
and like factories and industries is very much that way. 
just got done with the boss. 
so. 
got pluto expressed. 
ngl i am playing leageu and omori at the same time. 
yeah well i bet your friend is a sweat. 
im just a casual gamer. 
I BEAT SPACE BOYFRIEND FIRST TRY. 
wdym by this i am rotating this thought in my head. 
you did not just send me a textbook. 
ok this is actually very interesting i will read it tomorrow. 
ya interesting and that is a huge part of what dune is advocating is that if you try to fight the environment you will always lose. 
tri fun. 
trigun. 
what is that. 
NO FUCKING WAY THAT WORKS IRL. 
THATS SO FUNNY LMA. 
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT. 
big worm guy?. 
THATS SO FUCKING FUNNY. 
god worms are such creatures. 
holy shit i can literally be timothee chalamet and summon worms. 
oh i do think i remember this. 
kinda cursed this is your favorite part tho :/. 
ya that is true. 
they’re called ornithopters too which imo is really cool. 
hold on looking that up. 
what no no no. 
they are dragon flies. 
but. 
they flap their wings. 
i think that’s what the orni prefix means. 
maybe helithology is the study of the wheels on the bus?. 
hm maybe you are right. 
but. 
they are designed after dragonflies. 
yes!!. 
. 
yk in the books the ornithopters are barely talked about they just kinda exist. 
but they are badass as hell. 
unfortunately they exist on other planets too :(. 
who is yanma. 
oh ogey. 
ig that’s like. 
all the climates. 
omg yanma!!. 
i can’t ride that tho. 
ok hold on i need to change my pfp it’s bugging me now. 
so glad you do not know what cat this is. 
looks kinda painful ngl. 
yes i am aware wings flap. 
i am more talking about. 
the three big spikes. 
half elf human?. 
well. 
hm. 
you are right ig. 
i like the flowing dress or like side dress thing idk what it’s called it’s very fitting tho. 
also i don’t think you appreciated the floater enough. 
. 
this guy. 
the premise is like. 
you’re telling a joke. 
BUT. 
instead of saying. 
and here’s the kicker. 
HWRES THE FLOATER. 
. 
anyways ya i’m really funny :). 
thank you thank you good to know he’s appreciated. 
what.

so tragic that that series does not have a platformer it would be perfect. 
sigh..

ok i’m gout to sleep.

parkour. 
woah the ui looks cool. 
god figuring out the physics in a platformer is so hard. 
nothing i try feels good. 
it just feels. 
idk. 
awkward. 
i am reading a blog post on it rn. 
or ig a post by the maker of celsete. 
lmao acceleration i am simply setting my move speed right now. 
the hard part is movement in thea ir. 
do i accelerate them when theya rein the air?. 
i feel like now. 
no. 
but. 
:/. 
you are mean. 
can she fly. 
oh!. 
i wanted to tell you the idea i had for the game. 
ok. 
so. 
i want it to be a platformer with the core gimick of having multiple control modes. 
parkour, combat, and stealth. 
and with each mode you can do different things, and you need to mix and match the modes to get through a level. 
and there is only one bar and its like your stamina, i want to call it water. 
cause dune themed. 
and parkour mode uses the most water but you are the fastest and stealth mode you move the slowest but use the least water. 
so its like. 
each level will have elements of parkour, combat, and stealth. 
for some parts of the level you can choose between multiple modes depending on yoru play style and how you want to manage your water, and others you need to use one mode. 
i am pulling out the kinematic equations and enregy formuals for the physics of this game. 
. 
dot product woooo!!!. 
LMAO. 
ok but!. 
they mighte PARKOUR_SPEED_RATIO you. 
personally i think my STEALH_DECAY is lower than yours. 
ok my physics actually feels really good im very happy with it. 
. 
nope!. 
it doesnt wokr. 
give me a sec.

thoughts on this crouch image. 
he is standing still crouching. 
ones behind the other. 
i think the colors should be reversed. 
and the entire leg a little darker. 
ya. 
ok ok will co tie he working w. 
thx for help!. 
the legs look weird without an outline. 
. 
well. 
i think i need some sort of shading. 
ya :D. 
no. 
. 
liike here you can tell. 
i think/. 
but i dont like how the legs look. 
they are so blocky. 
i think the outlines helped smooth the legs out a litle. 
ya that looks way better :D. 
no say it it grants me inner strength. 
i think not having them right next to each other makes it look so much better. 
. 
these legs look off. 
WAH!. 
i will learn!!. 
bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum.

sigh can we both please drop out. 
ok but how about this farming thing can we get a hang of that together. 
Hello all ~ I don't see a name or a location for your business. The product choices are good, but I'd like you to revisit the strategy. You are proposing to sell full meals to unspecified college students late at night in unspecified locations. Student groups have tried this in the past and struggle to provide evidence that the venture is viable. The responses given aren't answering the 4 questions. There are many places where a food truck like this would do well and cater to customers interested in a quality, unique meal. Consider venues where food trucks regularly gather on nights and weekends, as replacements for restaurants. These are destination spots, with entertainment and events. If you choose to stay with the late night college student strategy, you need to clearly demonstrate the demand and volume to support your business. Find the unique and genuine location where this will work. Not Boston, and preferably not Miami. I've seen this work in a few places, but it's up to you to be creative. Keep thinking!! I'm looking forward to seeing next steps.. 
ignore me. 
sigh i am doing a project that is planning out the financials of a food truck in tallahasee and its making me so homesick. 
also song that i tihnk youd like. 
https://open.spotify.com/track/0qNrDydJChCsJItuqIrqRQ?si=3f44cff9a3684b37. 
i chose the thing :). 
but. 
its just projecting financials for a small business and i convinced my gorup to do food truck at tallahasee. 
this animation is very you. 
not anymore :). 
are we. 
playing games. 
👉👈. 
hailow. 
longest day of my life. 
how are you. 
not bad just long.

*well*. 
*technically*. 
you can rinse the eggs in cool water yk. 
and they will. 
cool down. 
ok thats. 
a bit. 
drastic. 
are these your eggs. 
you let a friend ice your eggs?. 
LMAO. 
wuh. 
are they still hot. 
surely. 
they should cool down really fast. 
also i hate hardboiled eggs i cant believe you are eating those. 
they are truly the worst form of egg. 
run them under water. 
disgusting i cant speak to you. 
water will cool them down faster than ice. 
sorry :(. 
also cold water will make them easier to peel too. 
LETS FUCKING GOOO. 
well actualy. 
hopefully the egg didnt actually drop D:. 
what is egg salad. 
btw. 
i dont think i have do tell i am very intrigued. 
that sounds.

:(. 
SORRY. 
Started a call that lasted 208 minutes.. 
grom. 
i do not know why there are people in my room. 
Yazheng. 
tragic im so sorry :(. 
have you heard of the quake 3 inverse square root. 
also if you want to play stardew but think i dont want ot just ask i would still want to play with you. 
its like a functoin that is a really fast way of calculating the inverse square root which is i think very important in vector math (?). 
anyways just a cool a little thing i watched a video on video game optimizations. 
i will enjoy any game if we are playing :). 
. 
also so random. 
rayyan just inited me to a cal. 
this guy is in the call. 
. 
this is. 
him in the call. 
i saw that and was like.

what will it do to you if you saw it. 
wuh. 
wuh tf. 
what is theoretical code. 
is that. 
code that is in your head but not written. 
keep it that way code needs to be disciplined or something. 
i feel like if you ran the code now and it doesnt work you will spend 8 hours fixing it as opposed to sleeping. 
omg same!. 
this might be the earliest i’ve seen you sleep. 
oh i’m so sorry :(. 
ya you should sleep. 
like. 
now. 
go. 
that is acceptable ig but you are going to get like. 
6 hours of sleep.

gn!. 
can we try to make stardew a regular thing. 
i’m running a beer mile. 
did they live D:. 
you chug a beer every quarter mile. 
it’ll be so much fun :). 
man i didn’t even bring my skateboard up. 
i have no chances to use it. 
and i’m too scared to practice. 
ok but like even twisting my ankel i am so scared of idk why. 
ive never really gotten hurt skateboarding but. 
really scared of it. 
so when i practice tricks i dont make any progress. 
i have left this water boiling for 30 mins. 
there is no water left. 
sigh. 
haiow. 
absolutely nothing. 
the pot melted :(. 
the kitchen burned down. 
i burned down too. 
yes lets play :). 
no i am naught but ashes. 
hello. 
that is hated. 
only hard boiled eggs??. 
how are you. 
sorry i did not have time to play today. 
boiled eggs and rice. 
at least make it scrambled D:. 
but. 
why is bok choy and eggs exclusive. 
and if your dinner is just eggs and rice with no seasoning i will not speak to you for two months. 
book hog. 
:). 
amen. 
also happy mid autumn dk if you celebrate. 
any. 
soy sauce. 
or. 
something. 
or. 
flavor. 
:(. 
please look up a recipe. 
i am going to get some tomorrow havent had a chance yet tragically. 
fair. 
girl dinner. 
of sorts. 
LMAO IM SORRY. 
IF I EVEN CARE. 
WHAT. 
thats so cute why would i not care D:. 
did you see the rabbit?. 
this is not really related but do you know what sky lanterns are. 
idk in my head it's related to mid autumn festival and ive always wanted to go to a sky latner festival. 
its thost lanterns that you release and they fly away. 
ive been obsessed with those lanterns since i was a kid for some reason. 
i used to try and build them with like random materials. 
they are cool as fuck. 
they never worked :(. 
tbf i used like. 
a trash bag, steel wire, and a candle so. 
idk. 
not the best design. 
BUT I WAS LIKE 8 SO. 
maybe now i am old enough to construct a functoinal one. 
also. 
what are you doing this weekend. 
like. 
7 days from now. 
what the fuck. 
when are you gone. 
i am coming back to orlando. 
could i. 
could i come to gainesville. 
on monday. 
ok ok sounds good. 
why are you going to atlanta >:(. 
sigh tragic timing :/. 
you have cousins everywhere. 
im dropping out of college and becoming a game dev. 
i know you mean from tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow but that made me think of ledden. 
sam is not an insult D:. 
(not leden). 
(the character). 
hailow. 
ok. 
tell me if im crazy for this but. 
i am so seriously considering taking an loa next semester and just playing games and making games. 
i am so so thinking about transferring right now. 
like i think i am 80% sure i will. 
yeah sort of? i actually dont plan on it being very chill but just spending a ton of time doing stuff that i am passionate about or really interested in. 
i do want it to be really productive and like practically also work somewhere during that time. 
mmm i just really dont like it here i think. 
or. 
babson is. 
ok. 
but. 
idk i think i can be so much happier and also do more somewhere else cause i just do not care about business at all. 
so. 
spending a semester just really trying to work i think would be really good for me personally, a lot of fun, and potentially also better like career / longterm wise. 
usc, mit, uf, bu, ucsf, and probably others i havent looked at the specific schools too much yet. 
ucsc. 
not sf. 
santa cruz. 
and boston university. 
uf no way! i didnt konw that!. 
buh. 
uf (read like sound effect). 
. 
this mf is two tiles wide i hate it here. 
i cant stand directly in front of him :(. 
its annoying. 
i hate him!!!!. 
i found a body pillow.... 
also today i picked up a book. 
it was like a blind date with a banned book so i didn’t know what book it was before i opened it. 
and. 
. 
this is the book i got. 
why did you send this to me 4 times. 
really hammered it into my belief system thank you. 
. 
jesus christ. 
aseprite. 
you. 
. 
grom grom grom grom. 
sorry just needed to send file to myself. 
. 
ya. 
my friend drew it. 
been working on this new art styl. 
. 
no. 
👉 👈. 
i am learning how to use shaders :). 
```
shader_type canvas_item;

uniform sampler2D screen_texture : hint_screen_texture, repeat_disable, filter_nearest;

void fragment(){
    vec4 base_pixel = texture(TEXTURE, UV);
    vec4 screen_pixel = texture(screen_texture, SCREEN_UV);
    
    float avg = (screen_pixel.r + screen_pixel.g + screen_pixel.b) / 3.0;
    float mult = avg / 0.5;
    
    COLOR.rgb = base_pixel.rgb * mult;
}
```. 
actually so simple to do in godot. 
actually. 
i am probably going to use the same art style for the coffee game i was working on. 
we hav decided to make some. 
unholy conglomerate of ideas. 
its now about an 8 year old whose sibling got a job at a coffee shop and its their idea of what a coffee shop is like. 
so. 
same gameplay as the game was i was making but. 
this new crayon looking art style. 
. 
doeso this look real. 
wait really. 
ill send it to you. 
. 
. 
which one do you htink looks the best. 
ya they are very similar i am just nit picking. 
hai. 
how are you.

:). 
and now you suffer for your hubris. 
lol i am SO going to miss my flight. 
turns out it’s flighing out of worcester not boston. 
well i guess god is real in some form because he made sure i didn’t miss my flight by damaging the airport it’s supposed to fly out of and delaying it by 5 hours and also at a different airport an hour away :3. 
all jet blue execs should be tried in court. 
i am finally home.

or. 
i am invested. 
but so easy to stop playing too. 
https://www.youtube.com/@InLoveWithAGhostMusic/videos. 
i hope this helps with your photoshop class?. 
. 
your pin and charm!!. 
my backpack is so scuffed and i was gonna throw it away but. 
i think i might just patch it up and have pins and stuff. 
why did they have to make the art so sad D:. 
. 
://// i might just stick to lvl 1 emotions because of this. 
hailow. 
how are you. 
:(. 
you have like 4 midterms this week right. 
or recent weeks. 
wtf D:.

LETS FUCING GOOOOOOOO THANK YOU BARACK. 
oh lmao.

i will report you to ucf. 
WELL. 
i wouldnt speak so fsat. 
ya school is killing me too. 
so so need to drop out. 
yk. 
ive been waking up early. 
and sleeping early. 
which is. 
fucking wild for me but anyways. 
i have been so much more productive this way. 
also i realized i just sent you a random youtube channel but i think youd really like their art and also music. 
they are on spotify too. 
i think they made some of the soundtrack for celeste(?). 
https://open.spotify.com/track/2XiVI1ZMabQc0VIChp9KoV?si=c9d2e8f6c1cc4846. 
but ya. 
incredible artist. 
and i gave in i looked up a ocmbat guide for omori. 
i have become wiki gamer. 
:(. 
i forgot my mouse at home ok omori combat is hard. 
um. 
i need to click the right wiki links in time?. 
holy fuck sweetheart's art is badass. 
her theme is baller too wtf. 
i find it very funny the kiss was censored. 
thank you what a word. 
god omori is a great game. 
ok im going to sleep gn!. 
i’m meeting rick riordan tomorrow. 
no but turns out he lives really close to it!. 
yes like in person. 
i know he’s not gonna believe it either!. 
it’ll be a surprise for both of us in different ways. 
nvm this setup failed :(. 
sigh nvm was supposed to be a joke. 
Started a call that lasted 1 minutes.. 
PICK UP!!!!!. 
whatever it’s funnier this way. 
i’m going to sleep gn!. 
but i am actually meeting rick riordan he’s coming to boston. 
do you have any questions you’d like to ask him. 
i already have a request to ask if percy jackson and jason are a thing. 
i will ask some crazy out of pocket questions. 
anyways sorry i drunk called i hope that is okay i was just thinking about you. 
i didn’t get to meet him there was an hour line :(. 
also i have an interesting thought. 
i know you are against ai generated art. 
but. 
consider video games are art. 
what are your thoughts on ai generated code in a game. 
people were there at 9 am when the event is 10:30 sigh. 
really like games specifically. 
or just ai code. 
really i feel like in 2 years ai code will be really good i mean its like. 
not that bad?. 
from the times that i have used it was actually really impressed with results. 
ya it sucks at the story telling aspect but i mean like. 
imagine making a game and a human writes all the story and makes the art and designs the mechanics. 
but the mechanics are implemented through ai generated code. 
interesting take hm. 
i was just talking to my friends about it today and i thought youd have strong opinoins on this. 
how are you. 
is hope your work is not too stressful and stuff. 
hai did you watch the minecraft stream. 
everytime i see OTZ i think its a face and the O and Z are the eyes and the T is some fucked up mouth. 
woooooo!!!!. 
how were your midterms and like 8 other projects. 
and no way the armadillo won there was to be some sort of voter fraud. 
no we rebel.. 
pretty good i didnt get to see rick riordan but i did get to see max miller. 
he is this youtuber who does food history i love his channel. 
i have so much work too ive been dying sigh. 
. 
thoughts on this pixel art?. 
still work in progress but. 
. 
supposed to be her. 
ya i moved the hat but only the bottom part and ive been too lazy to move the top. 
wait but 1 2 1 where. 
im not really sure how to add the border lines within the body no matter how i do it it looks too prominent. 
hm ya. 
im struggling a lot with proportions. 
but 1 pixel neck seems way too thin. 
mmmm idk if i want realistic proportions i want them to be almost chibi like. 
if that makes sense. 
you hate her and wish her to have a shorter torso so you can see less of her :(. 
honestly i have no clue what style im going for. 
i cant really get this style off well on pixel art. 
no i appreciate it its very helpful. 
well main thing. 
i dont think i want the character to be too realistic. 
i think maybe tho i shoul dhave the right proportions height wise and just make her really wide so almost like a cube?. 
maybe ill make her a minecraft block texture?. 
also. 
idk if this makes sense but i want her to look "cloudlike" and so her movements in game will be very floaty and smooth. 
i don’t want it to be exactly chibi but i think head to torso 1:1 would look good. 
here let me find a reference. 
. 
MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MOEWOWMEOWMWWOOWWOAA MRAWWWWWWWWWW. 
ok i’m going to sleep. 
gn!!. 
mraw mraw mraowwwww!. 
. 
. 
. 
thoughts in terms of proportions. 
yeah they just look like tubes. 
but maybe we are all tubes after all. 
. 
ive changed the colors a little. 
. 
hai. 
how are you. 
im done with midterms!!!!!!!!!!!. 
so totally failed one of them and also submitted possibly the worst essay of my life but. 
well. 
what is done is done. 
i think ive actually achived an end result im pretty happy with. 
. 
yes i always want feedback. 
also how was your day. 
HOLY SHIT TWO IN LIKE WHAT LIKE TWO WEEKS???????????. 
what did you win. 
show. 
this is the highlight of my day. 
what teh fuck. 
i hate it. 
day ruined nvm. 
it says egg yolk. 
:/. 
they deserve it i think maybe. 
no but its actualy very cute. 
looks very round and fluffy. 
;(. 
youre going to make me cry. 
. 
look what you did :(. 
youre literally eating baby chickens why would you do that. 
well ya but. 
baby animals are imo less acceptable. 
WUH. 
are you busy rn. 
sigh. 
we never call :(. 
thats ok i just want to talk to you. 
hope you are not too stressed or anything. 
also working on walking animation now. 
i think she will only skip as that is a more "floaty" walk imo. 
. 
. 
. 
no it just has a repeated frame when she’s at the very top. 
idk it doesn’t quite look like she’s skipping. 
if i make it so that the frames where she’s one pixel in front it i isn’t and centered like the rest of the frame it looks better at a gif but i think it might look weird in game. 
i haven’t tested in game yet so idk what’ll look better. 
i tried that but idk how to do that without shifting her two pixels up. 
like. 
look at the ones where her foot are 3 straight pixels. 
idk where to cuttoff her leg to leave an empty pixel without messing up proportions. 
do i just leave the foot shape as is and just move her one pixel up?. 
the feet be straight as opposed to the L is supposed to show that she’s like on her tip tos. 
yeah i just noticed that i think another reason is like they are both showing on every frame which makes it look weird. 
like on the one where the arms switch sides i think only one should be showing. 
i’ve literally been doing nothing but this all day pixel art is consuming me. 
so easy to lose track of time too. 
also. 
are you busy this weekend. 
do you have time to game 👉👈. 
ok ok. 
man i wish i could just go home on a weekend. 
it’s baby carson!. 
ok but actually how the fuck did you get the egg to be that shaped what.

hm. 
if i fence epee i will use it lke a foil. 
IM SORRY. 
ITS SO ENGRAINED TO ME. 
LIKE. 
like about a year. 
not that long but?. 
like what part of the body is a target is just so integral. 
i thikn that middle would. 
form a triangle. 
hm true. 
i think closer to foil honestly bceause of right of way?. 
ya :D. 
arent saber touches like. 
over in a second. 
also i am responding slow as a i am playing league of legends™️. 
:/. 
im almost emerald rank?. 
if that. 
makes it better. 
hm. 
i feel like foil and saber are both more fun than epee :). 
DO YOU HAVE LETHAL COMPNAY. 
>:::(((((. 
in every world :). 
no its like. 
because of right of way sometimes you get like crazyback and forths in foil. 
and those are so cool. 
ya i was going to say. 
we are paying letahl do you want to watch. 
devastating. 
but you should get thsi game its so much fun. 
i cant spoil :). 
you need to play this game blind. 
TRUST ME ITS SO MUCH FUN. 
its horror but like. 
not that scary. 
not pyschological in any way. 
ah that is fair :D. 
ok but that game is like multiplayer i dont think youd ever play lethal by yourself. 
and its also an indie game !!!. 
what are you doing tomorow??. 
ya i thought so too but like. 
what are we doing :D. 
just got out the most tilting game of my life sigh. 
is the suggestion ice skating :D.

ya i think so and i think theres not that many clubs around here. 
wait if we go ice skating tho. 
carson and dakota can also come tomororw?. 
let’s do ice skating :D. 
give me a sec. 
i will plan. 
i got this. 
ice skating at 2-4:45 at ice den?. 
ya that works. 
i will let carson and adkota know. 
but. 
i think they might not be able to make it?. 
but. 
eith erway. 
could we actually just do something later on the day instead of ice skating :D. 
like. 
worlds shittiest fencing bout. 
like. 
6?. 
maybe later depends when i eat dinner. 
just woke up :D. 
hm. 
good question. 
i guess let’s just meet at your house and see how it works just. 
outside?. 
yippeee!. 
it adds challenge. 
are you scared. 
wait do you not fence on strips usually. 
ah :D. 
no budget. 
huh?. 
how did you guys get kicked out.

GEO GUESSER. 
sorry need to go on this tangent first. 
theres this really quiet chinese guy living in the same floor as me and he got intorudced to geogusser recently and every night we see him playing that game on the communal tv. 
his name is alan he is so funny. 
ahmen.. 
idk. 
i never played that game. 
but. 
ive been ok. 
busy as hell. 
school and midterms was actually hard this sem :D. 
actually. 
not even the class from my school. 
my class from olin is really hard. 
yippee!!!!. 
i am curretnly. 
3(?) weeks behind on a assignment. 
data structures and algorithms. 
actually really interesitng but. 
its at 10 am. 
erm. 
data structure and algorithms. 
ik we talked about this before :). 
uh rn i think we are doing. 
emr. 
erm. 
uh. 
dynamic programming?. 
im a bit. 
lost. 
but we did all the like typical stuff for this class like search and sort algorithms and stuff. 
and then. 
well all of that was like. 
followable. 
and then dynamic programming bleh. 
its. 
like the idea is simple. 
like imagine an array. 
with the first element filled. 
and then what you do is basically calculate the next element based on prevoius elements. 
like. 
think about the fibonaci sequence. 
each number is sum of previous 2. 
instead of doing that recursively you use an array and iterate over the array. 
?. 
mmm. 
bad explanation. 
but like. 
ya you use that array and you basically fill it out to solve a problem. 
which like. 
makes snese?. 
but then. 
with some problems instead of being an array its like a 2d or 3d array and then it just like becomes impossible to visualize and its just like. 
trust me this works :). 
ok i talked to som other people and its not usually part of this class. 
i think its more usually part of discrete. 
idk why we cover it. 
ig useful for engineers or something idk. 
haha what even is discrete. 
what have you proved. 
yippee :))). 
creditted nap time or game time love those. 
i play rain world every day in my econ class. 
yippeee!!!. 
he slinks around i love him. 
my one true love is the slugcat.... 
also. 
i cant finish omori. 
i launched the other day. 
and im lost. 
like idk whats happening. 
im lost in the story. 
its been to long. 
i think i found the fishing scene. 
wah. 
i couldbu tlike ..... 
uh.

you are forced to observe its outputs sorry. 
```
He could not grasp his new universe in motionless, labeled bits.
There they sat shielded from the sietch, strapped on maula pistols and crysknives, slipped the Fremkit packs onto their shoulders.
He'd glimpsed something just then like a vision, but not a vision.

send me any big piece of text. 
i will make generator. 
omg. 
i will generate you.
