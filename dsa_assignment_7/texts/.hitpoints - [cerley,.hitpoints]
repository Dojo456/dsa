You don’t like the great music bot we used last time?. 
What the fuck dude I was amazing. 
The bot was great at krunker.io. 
And that’s really all you need from a music bot. 
What else could you possibly need from a music bot. 
Hm yknow, fair enough. 
I’ll add Triston next time. 
Of course. 
He can sing, percussion, and strings, all in the loosest terms. 
He physically can do those things. 
The quality of which I cannot guarantee. 
only give him permission to speak in the bot channel, mute him when he's not in vc?. 
Oh wow you own the server?. 
im 90% sure sanj owns it. 
yeah theres a 10% chance you own it. 
but you don't know, the ownership of the server was passed to you without your knowledge.

O that’s so cool. 
for stealing traffic cones of course. 
i think you should try and eat it and see what happens. 
Wow! That sounds like a Great Deal!. 
that’s not a bad idea, i should try that. 
also i had a dream that i got a cat im literally so devastated that it wasn’t real. 
hmmmmm any cat…….. 
this is a hard question. 
he’s doing a great job. 
my dream cat was a calico, maybe a tortoiseshell, my favorite neighborhood stray cat was a tortoiseshell. 
what color cat would YOU want. 
of course i do!!!!!! i named it pat, theres like a shit ton of stray cats in my neighborhood. 
TABBY CAT, they truly are. 
my brothers girlfriend has a cat and he shows me pictures all the time im so jealous he gets to hang out with a cat :(. 
APPARENTLY EVERY TIME THEY USE THE AIR FRYER IT GOES OFF.

kitty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 
hampter. 
you can have the very large oppossum from my backyard. 
WHERES THE FUCKING E. 
thank you. 
i couldnt find the e idk why. 
get unsleepy and create cake. 
am also very sleepy though. 
:(. 
cake tomorrow. 
had class then practice, i have like no stamina so it killed me dead. 
fun though, had lunch with a friend. 
how was your day. 
why are YOU so sleep. 
LMAO L + RIZZLESS. 
yup yup. 
then do it coward. 
fun!(?) can i ask who. 
get unsleepy then :/ skill issue. 
ohhhh i see. 
wow so young........ 
skill issue. 
im so glad im not 13 anymore. 
:( TAKE IT BACK. 
you know weirdly enough like. all of my family friends go to UF. 
i literally have a class with one of them. 
yeah its crazy. 
(you cant. fuck you). 
her name is vianna but they all went to olympia high. 
fair enough, the only person i talk to from wps at UF is tessa. 
ive got one up on you :). 
including me? 🥺. 
good.. 
what the fuck. 
dont delete your messages my jokes not funny anymore. 
hmmmmm. 
okay. 
of course. 
its dota. 
i can imagine though, its very nice to go to college with tessa even if we dont really see each other. 
what are you playing if not league then. 
some crimes can never be forgiven..... 
drums so you can. 
keyboard is more like, versatile for playing solo yk you can play more that sounds good on its own (no offense to drums but yk)
drums are cooler and less common. 
i love instrumence. 
simply learn both :/. 
invent a new instrument, like the accordian or keytar. 
the drumtar, i see no issues with this hypothetical instrument. 
dont think about it too hard. 
its like a flute and a piano if you dont think about it. 
crumb. 
. 
you could always just learn piano at least until you get Drum Set Access. 
i have keyboard access too :)!. 
meow meow machine. 
harmeownica. 
i love my meow meow machine its my personal compromise for not being able to take up my keyboard. 
i would kill to see a real harmeownica, no fucking clue how that would work. 
nah we have one in one of our libraries and my friend has one they offered to let me use, but ive got my guitar up here anyways. 
FINE.... but only for the sake of the harmeownica. 
D:. 
the stray cats are at home but actually. 
there are also many stray cats at UF. 
both. 
theres one by one of the dining halls named tenders.............. 
never seen tenders before unfortunately but i love her with all my heart. 
simply get mediocre at a large amount of things. 
i should visit her................. 
its fun! quit your job join my emo band. 
UGH in sophmore year we had the perfect band name but kini said it was too problematic >:(. 
it was caligula, now all i have on my band names list is sunfish chariot. 
the real emperor named caligula did bad things but like..... uh yeah he was a roman emperor. 
caligula was his nickname and it meant little boots. 
i just. woke up one day and thought of sunfish chariot. 
in the most literal sense i woke up texted my ex roommates to ask if that was a good band name then fell back asleep :). 
i was thinking about the actual concept of a sunfish chariot. 
theyre so big. 
what possible issues are there :D?. 
what hte fuck. 
remember it. 
i think a sunfish could be on land if they believe. 
dw i got you. 
it got a pretty good rating, like 8/10 i think. 
yeah, not a good EMO band name. 
maybe a pop punk band. 
new band name idea: DEAD SUNFISH >:(. 
oh thats good that way the sunfish is alive. 
yes yes these are great ideas. 
i agree i agree. 
uhhhh saw fish. coelecanth. pike?. 
sturgeon.

piano!!. 
i am nodding fantastic plan. 
please do please do. 
uhhhhh. 
im such an expert this is so true. 
idk youre fine as long as you can read sheet music well, play fun songs to keep interested or something. 
like the only things i know how to play are video game soundtracks and like, 50% at LEAST is undertale/deltarune. 
yeah i took lessons through hgih school. 
yeah i dont think itd be bad one of my friends is doing that. 
the other daniel in fact. 
its an eggman quote from the sonic fan dubs :/. 
he can already play the drums though so you gotta catch up. 
NO HES TALKING TO TAILS. 
I MISS MY WIFE TAILS
NOT MY WIFE, TAILS. 
??????? WHAT IS CONFUSING THIS TIME. 
they were about to fight if thats any consolation. 
. 
is that why they’re all -. 
okay so. 
i found out that when you queue songs and you’re listening to a playlist. 
it will show up as on the playlist to others. 
is that why they (donkeys) are always screaming. 
i read the song in a post and it got stuck in my e head. 
fennekin the pokémon would play league (and it’s evolution). 
also: yes! i am dressing up. 
although i’m concerned cause it’s gonna be like. high 40s. 
tomorrow, and i don’t have a suitable jacket. 
this so google tells me. 
this! cool shirt, but to be frank, the pants are my school pants. 
THANK YOU, it’s not the saber earring though it’s another sword earring with a snake around it. 
see, i’m thinking that too. 
i’ve got a cape but idk if it’ll look good with it since it’s so bright red. 
i’ll see tomorrow morning. 
should just whole sale bring my epee. 
i will not, no way to actually carry it. 
drive the two hours coward. 
i’m going at 12 it’s till 5 idk if i’ll be there the full time. 
you should you should. 
D:. 
it’s cake or the renfaire daniel. 
hm… would have to get at middle point like 11 or earlier. 
i could do that for some cake. 
but that’s like, a lot more total driving time?. 
2 hours there and back, then later 2 hours there and back, x2 for both of us. 
that’s not how that works hold on. 
LMAO. 
okay alternative idea: simply come here. 
bring cake materials: make cake after ren faire. 
i don’t have like. pans or bowls though so that’s included. 
yeah. 
fair enough fair enough. 
you should though because. 
ren faire. 
AND cake. 
AND me (the objective coolest person on earth).

as much as i would have last semester, i have graded attendance, and a graded lecture quiz :/. 
you have to be the one to get everyone together at a certain time. 
mm itll be a short campaign, i actually havent thought about what i should run. 
pensive v apologizes but. 
technically my class is free tohugh.

so true. 
this theme song fucking sucks. 
i can send you my scheudle for dnd purposes if you want. 
LMAO you joke but i have a spreadsheet of my players school schedules. 
i give them a little spotify wrapped summary of how many overlaps and whos the most problematic. 
**ACTUALLY THEYRE NOT AND THATS WHY THEYRE THE MOST PROBLEMATIC**. 
okay most problematic is settled by who has the most individual periods, aka who has the most classes when no one else has class. 
the one causing me the most problems has not a lot of classes in the first place. 
they refuse to take the night time transportation system (its like a free campus uber thats perfectly safe...). 
but of course im never free till 5, and weekends people go out of town, or have other plans (my sundays are fully booked now). 
planning on telling everyone that sessions will happen 5:30-8:30 on thursdays, and if they cant make it sorry. 
im too busy on weekends to continue having sessions then. 
haha!.

of course of course.

HAHAHAHA.

okay. 
its like, annoying to have 1 person online. 
business major. 
its hard for them to hear what everyone is saying, and its hard to hear what they're saying. 
its like if all your friends hang out and they face time you, youre not actually there. 
thats what my ex roommates are telling them. 
telling me. 
they offered to quit actually. 
they said worst case they wont go. 
yeah i just feel bad about it. 
theres not really any avoiding it. 
yeah thasts true. 
hopefully but they are a junior. 
my short campaign accidentally took two semesters i have horrible estimates for how long things take :D. 
for funsies :D. 
maybe but theyre a bit awkward and shy, they didnt come to my birthday party cause there was like, 4 people they didnt know. 
yeah, ive thought a bout it for a few weeks too. 
just an unfortunate situation. 
hm, thats not a bad idea actually. 
ill bring that up in the gc. 
online is easier, people are more willing to stay up late than go out late.

so like there was a volcanic crater thats smoke would kill birds, so they thought it was the entrance to the underworld. 
sam didnt get it when he gave me p. 
scansion. 
sam didnt get it when he gave me peer feedback, he commented "what? this makes no sense. myth can't effect geography.". 
our valedictorian. 
yup. 
i lvoved the IAs. 
some of the examples are strange, like i count names as geography. 
and walls it seems. 
im re reading it. 
mythological explanation for a certain set of walls in romes.

that fucking sequence in arcane was so good literally cannot stop thinking about it. 
they put so much into that show everything is increedible. 
wym?. 
2d 3d or both. 
i guess 2d cause same style, but! we learned about this in class recently, 
theres like a few different things
of course theres the fact that the animators are professionals and are told to draw in the style (its a very fun way to draw i like to do style copies a lot :D)

theres also like a show bible(?), which is a guideline to drawing characters (example of one from adventure time) https://thinkinganimation.com/draw-adventure-time-pendleton-ward/. 
(this part im unsure about for american animation, i learned about this in relation to japanese animation but its very possible that it applies to both cause thatd make sense)

but theres a director who goes over the keyframes and what not to make sure that everything fits within the style and redlines (drawse over the drawings with a red line) to correct anything thats off. 
theres also like, character reference sheets. 
and with american animation especially, shows are in charge of writing, storyboards, backgrounds etc, but might outsource the actual animation to a studio typically in asia. 
theres also like, puppet animation where the charcaters essentailly have models that can be moved and manipulated (i talked about that already) but they have all different angles and movements and w/e that also keep the animation consistent. 
sometimes though there are little nuances between storyboard artists that make it so you can tell who boarded an episode, steven unvierse was kind of notorious for this, but it even happens in shows like mob psycho, okay thats like all i know i think. 
its easier than youd think since cartoons tend to be simple. 
style copies i did for funsies. 
hi!. 
dont be bored D:. 
im procrasinating studying for my calc exam :/. 
... watching animatics and thinking about dungeons and dragons. 
yes! very true, i am thinking about what to run for you guys.

like, i think of it left to right, but people whose language read right to left typically think of it as such. 
of course of course that makese sense. 
it would probably be whichever way their clocks go. 
i cant imagine that their clocks would be different...?. 
cause arabic numbers are pretty universally used yk, so clocks can be from anywhere. 
but half way around we read it right to left. 
??? D:. 
why not?. 
god i love sandals by khai dreams.

would you believe me if i said i was in a time loop??. 
THANK YOU. 
no one fucking believes me it’s been a month. 
common misconception! a week is the massively popular battle royale kids game, a month is those bugs that like light. 
one fundamental feature of a programming language is a loop, a loop allows the code to repeat itself multiple times in order to reduce repetitive code and increase readability. 
okay everyone’s correcting their answer to you would have to convince me which is FAIR i GUESS..

one of the first minecraft videos i watched was a pixelmon mod review. 
an envelope deformer is commonly used in 2d puppet animation in order to modify the shape of symbols attatched to the puppet, to make it feel less like a puppet and more like a solid being with mass.

well first, i had some melon bread i forgot at home, and so tessa brought it to me, and then it expired and that was so so sad :( 
then i had a quiz
then i thought i lost my apple pencil ($99!!!!) so i checked where i was sitting in the library, submit a missing item report, and checked the classroom i was just in just to find out it was in a box in my backpack
then i realized i forgot my student id in my apartment so i left the library to my apartment, turns out! i left that in orlando! which is important to take my test (luckily! my TA said he knew who i was so that was fine)
calculus test
but its fine now because the test is over and i did fine on my quiz :).

rpbobaly. 
oh shit. 
ive seen this in my college library. 
they had like a month about games and this was one of the books on display i think. 
he was bullied off tumblr. 
ive read some of his books. 
i. 
so he was on tumblr in the era where you could edit OTHER PEOPLES POSTS. 
and someone edited his post to this. 
yeah i remember those times. 
it was, certainly an interesting feature. 
he left tumblr shortly after. 
:D. 
how was. 
your day. 
you are. 
in a league game. 
all good im trying to figure out this fucking code >:(. 
i figured it out im a god. 
yup yup im using godot. 
okay so. 
i’ve read a stupid amount of that book. 
it’s good. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU5Qq97cxvU. 
i actually read so much of it that i said i cant read anymore till saturday cause i have work to do :(. 
yes. 
i think the cat breads help out after theyre made though. 
yes. 
that is what i meant. 
i love picking up a book and reading random chapters in whole. 
the oven!. 
they are baked. 
it is okay they are warm!. 
i think if i was microwaved i would be warm?. 
a lot of the characters in the book are like, relatable in different ways, its also very interesting how many time skips there are. 
miniwaved. 
HARD i enjoy all of them and also they all have bad. 
hate dov, obviously. 
marx?. 
love marx. 
like karl. 
karl marx. 
yeah. 
he is karl marx. 
his last name is watanabe isnt it. 
my friends dnd character had that last name. 
i like sam but hes a bit of an asshole sometimes, i like sadie but shes a bit of an asshole sometimes. 
fascinating. 
the flashes to the future make it very interesting also, i like the random interview clips. 
YES i was just ognna say. 
they havent said much. 
they got married. 
YES THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS THINKING. 
that looks so close to the discord color. 
hmmm you know i think if you were an animal. 
you would be a grass hopper. 
i havent read a full book since alaska fun fact. 
what the FUCK:(. 
im 1/3. 
the way done. 
the shooting maybe just happened, they got a text from marx. 
i cant ill get sucked in :(. 
how does that even work. 
do your essay :(. 
. 
HE GOT FUCKING SHOT????. 
i just can’t fucking believe i said marx was my favorite character for real moments before he gets fucking shot. 
i love wearing shirts over hoodies it’s so fucked up. 
is the shirt bright red important question. 
ITS SO ):. 
his whole chapter in his death was so interesting though. 
and the tax evasion hoodie is hot pink! (unlike mine which is a good pastel pink). 
yesss i’m almost half way through i think. 
which is crazy. 
so much has happened and i’m only half way through. 
i just looked to see how long it was and found this on google. 
. 
oh. 
OH. 
OH MY GOD. 
okay obviously emily b marks is sadie, or some metaphor or in game avatar. 
obviously. 
emily quest marx etc. 
it took me longer to realize dr daedalus was sam. 
daedalus = maker of mazes. 
used to dabble in mathematics of course gave it away. 
i mean daedalus = made the labrinth = makes mazes = sam. 
the pronouns obscured this. 
not fucking ludo quintus. 
i play, five, marks daedalus. 
AHAHAH THATS A POEM QUOTE. 
not a poem quote, it’s LIKE a poem but i don’t remember which it is bothering me. 
. 
haha i get it. 
the roles are reversed. 
ignore what time i sent this message anyways,.

megacon!! big one me and myra went.

so fun!! exciting stuff. 
did you get all moved?. 
oooh that’s nice that’s nice. 
. 
oh boy, well good thing it’s almost over. 
only myra says hi back. 
. 
https://everydaylouie.itch.io/windsor-road check out this cute game by my favorite artist, its in boston, youre also in boston.

oooh fun how is it. 
go eep!!!. 
all good moving is stressful!! night :). 
what the fuck. 
kill them. 
hunt them down and kill them. 
sad :(. 
that fucking sucks fr tohugh. 
not very. 
oh except the next 2-3 days ill be busy. 
i got plans tomorrow and then im gone till uhhh 11th? 12th, i should figure that out. 
my plans got cancelled today i’m so sad D:. 
california!! for a couple days only. 
i was gonna get lunch n go to some of the asian grocery stores on colonial with myra and triston. 
but i think myra got sick :(. 
sigh and there’s no rescheduling cause triston’s going somewhere for like a month or two?. 
of course of course we'll just face time him. 
have you seen the new trigun. 
trigun is an old manga and it just got like uhh a new anime and it’s very good and cool and well animated. 
sorry i mean yeah it’s three guns it’s like the shinzo abe assassins 9 barrel shot gun. 
oooooo steampunk festival!!! uhhhh. 
just wear like. 
white button up and.. 
brown. 
go to party city and buy those steampunk goggles boom steampunk. 
YES. 
bring a cog. 
i finished it last night :) it’s only 12 episodes. 
no no. 
i watched like 6, last night, still a lot but!. 
also, things like that are fun, there’s probably a good amount of people who don’t dress up, i’ve never been to a steampunk thing but i imagine it’s pretty similar to a rennfaire. 
in which it’s kind of like a farmers market, but with fun trinkets and crafts, probably. 
trigun stampede is like, 3d animated, but they do it soooo well, there’s really been some incredible advancements in 3d animation recently it’s super cool. 
woo!!!! you should simply uhhhh go to… boston market. 
OKAY so trigun is not doing anything crazy new with 3d animation, its animated by studio orange which is im pretty sure a 3d animation studio, and they made beastars which was already super good for 3d animation. 
beastars for fun visuals, it actually took me a bit to realize it was 3d animated. 
so trigun stampede doesn’t have anything incredible in terms of like, shading and technology BUT the way they use all of it is really cool. 
so like, first of all trigun is really cartoonishly expressive, i believe they actually resculpt the models in order to exaggerate them. 
second off, they do detail very well, i can’t articulate this very well but the details don’t feel out of place
they have complicated guns and limbs n stuff but they fit in with the style. 
contrast that with studio oranges earlier work land of the lustrous, which in my opinion looks good but the hair just always looks a bit out of place. 
and okay this is gonna be also hard to articulate but the actual animation style, as in the movement of the animation, is incredible

the characters are almost always moving even in the background their expressions still change

also er i might need to find an example of it but i just remember thinking that they use anticipation really well in the animation. 
OKAY I AM NOT THE BEST AT TALKING ABOUT 3D ANIMATION BUT ITS JUST VERY COOL TO SEE ALL OF THE ADVANCEMENTS IN THE FIELD FROM THE REPETITIVE SAME-Y DISNEY MOVIES TO HOTEL FUCKING TRANSYLVANIA TO SPIDERVERSE AND ARCANE AND SHIT
I USED TO DISLIKE 3D ANIMATION BUT ITS A VERY COOL INDUSTRY NOW I HOPE THEY UNIONIZE THOUGH. 
okay i might find the clips later BUT i’m actually seeing oleyar in LA :)! you are probably asleep  good night. 
did you enjoy your dinner. 
frfr i just saw the trailer for the fuckinggg teenage mutant ninja turtle movie and it’s fantastic. 
the backgrounds are super cool. 
i think animation has been getting more popular as not just for kids, although that’s been happening for a while but still. 
YES you should. 
you should learn digital art its so fun. 
yeah so true so true. 
DOG :D. 
HE NAPPED ON YOUR LEG.   !!!.

shes got something in the morning too. 
wym my classes are all 50 minutes unless theyre a double period.

. 
. 
my friend, who has been playing as of today, has already unlocked pluto’s space line. 
you have no fucking clue. 
CONGLATULATIONS 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉. 
okay i had to like. 
find my source. 
https://pubs.usgs.gov/dds/dds-43/VOL_II/VII_C09.PDF. 
it’s a paper :). 
just read the abstract. 
like native americans weren’t just like, wild people without technology yk, they had technology it just looked like nature to the europeans though. 
👍. 
dune is like… trigun. 
giant worms…. 
MY FAVORITE PART OF DUNE IS HOW THEY USE STAMPER THINGS TO POUND THE EARTH TO SUMMON WORMS JUST LIKE REAL LIFE. 
manga, and a really good anime. 
the second adaptation is really good i’ve never watch. 
YES YES IT DOES. 
IVE ONLY WATCHED THE MOVIE BUT. 
WHEN I SAW IT I WAS LIKE THEYRE SUMMONING TBE FUCKING WORMS. 
I SAW A VIDEO. 
IT WORKS BECAUSE. 
IF YOU HIT THE GROUND CONSISTENTLY THE WORMS THINK ITS RAIN, AND GO TO THE SURFACE SO THEY DONT DROWN. 
THATS EHY YOU FIND WORMS ON THE PACE@ENT WHEN ITS RAINING. 
ITS GREAT. 
anyways i think i talked about trigun stampede (the modern adaptation) when i went on that  ramble about 3d animation and how good it’s gotten. 
SO true summon worms. 
the movie is. 
okay. 
the dragonfly ships were really cool. 
omg like ornithology. 
and helicopter. 
what the fuck that’s so stupid. 
they call them bird planes. 
ornith-bird
opter-helicopter. 
they go round and round!. 
they are designed after dragonflies and that is very cool. 
SJDJFH. 
and they are dragonflies like in the desert. 
like yanma……. 
it’s okay dragonflies live near lakes too. 
. 
yanma. 
yk i had a dnd character based on dragonflies i did like, a solid amount of research on them for that. 
maybe you can ride on yanmega?. 
what’s wrong with sasuke. 
. 
cat!. 
calopteryx virgo my lovely dragonfly druid. 
maybe on the tail, because the wings would be flapping. 
but the wings get in the way of you sitting there. 
aasimar. 
thank you it took a very long time to figure out how i wanted the dress to be. 
the bird plane?. 
OH.

that’s devastating. 
i’m sorry for your loss.

if we are talking about what i would rather hit me in the head i think bowling.

gwhhg i was at practice, i don’t wanna be a sheep though :/. 
you should join the UF fencing club. 
isn’t it fucked up that the bluetooth symbol is like, a nordic rune. 
i mean it’s fucked up that it’s called in bluetooth in the first place but. 
here’s my fucked up mirror (it’s fucked up because it has bluetooth (which is fucked up that it’s called… etc etc)
and it’s like, pretty basic symbol and then in the middle a nordic rune. 
is what my shadow shirt? my playlist image, then yes. 
. 
i have two shadows hirts!. 
its named for a fucked up reason. 
im sorry mirror :(. 
what the fuck my professor jsut spoiled the titanic. 
no no i wont spoil it dw. 
:). 
i will npt spoil it i am strong to my beliefs. 
today is so. 
i skippedmy first lecture cause its recorded, i have class till 2 (calc quiz today D: was in library till 1), then 2-4 im gonna go flyering for fencing, 4-5 i have vietnamese lessons, ive got 3 assignments due at midnight and i said id hang out with a friend at like, 7.

OAH T-T. 
ASEPRITE ITS $20 ITS THE BEST PIXEL ARY PROGRAM ITS TKHE SO SO WORTH IT I USE IT ALL THE TIME ITS SO SO SO GOOD. 
gundam ita bag. 
yes it’s so good i have it open all the time. 
i spread aseprite propaganda in my classes as well. 
it’s really good it’s also connected with unity. 
so you can put the sprites along with all their animations in there. 
it’s so cheap compared to other art programs (but like yk it’s not like you’re buying other art programs). 
fair but it’s so good. 
if you’re not doing a lot of spriteing it doesn’t matter. 
omori reference. 
. 
YIPEEEEEEE!!!!!!!. 
ORANGE CAT BAG 💥💥💥. 
i cant see it very well :( scale it up. 
it’s like the same color as discord :(. 
is there no export setting that lets you do that. 
LMAO okay i can. 
. 
for the record the image looks like. 
but i can. 
oh i see i see. 
what are you using again, godot?. 
the animation is very smooth. 
the arms are good!!!. 
YIPEEE I CAN SEE IT GOOD. 
do you want advice or no. 
yeah the head should move up and down, and he looks like he's shuffling, so the legs should be picked up at certain points. 
you can always just look up walk cycle and look up the poses they do and follow that. 
oh okay of coursee. 
when one foot is off the ground the head should be up when both are on the ground it should be down. 
the heel thing dissappears for one frame. 
but it looks a lot better!. 
i hope people are confused as shit. 
so fascinating. 
is this the job at the maker space?. 
nice. 
they are gamers. they will understand.. 
SKJDh. 
personal choice, you can always make an idle animation that plays after a certain amonut of time too. 
okay, i will hear it later. 
fuck off. 
yes. 
:O :I :O :I :O :I. 
SCOUT. 
why are you scout tf2. 
wuh. 
no thats how normal people jump i promise. 
ya! wah! hoooo!. 
grahhhh fr ive been so busy. 
night!! i will. 
no i dont think so. 
https://libresprite.github.io/#!/#page-top aseprite but free and vaguely weird. 
it is, but its a little weird since its a fork of aseprite instead of the actual thing. 
watch that one video on celeste physics hold on. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yorTG9at90g&t=533s. 
celeste is such a great game to play. 
i got my scripts working 👍. 
rip 😔✌️. 
i think "theya rein the air" is my new dnd character. 
shes gonna be an air genasi sorceror of the storm. 
oh interesting. 
thats pretty cool, the level design on that should be really interesting. 
& lots of replayability. 
wowowow. 
just like how im using linear algebra in mine ~~not really but it has helped me with the coding~~ ~~i have never thought about vectors so much in my life help me~~. 
PARKOUR ACCELERATION RATIO is what i yell to the cops chasing me as i climb up a building to escape arrest. 
oh god oh no. 
then ill have to STEALTH (?) idk what youre variables for that are called im assuming. 
nuh uh. 
yippeee!!!!!!!. 
this isnt a virus right. 
the funny thing is, that i sent my friend a build of my game once and all her friends actually thought it was a virus. 
ill look at it when im done with my matlab assignment :,). 
can you kill htem. 
tyty. 
GUNDAM!!!!. 
WOWOWOWOWOW. 
it looks better!, i can tell thats a knife but i cant really that that he's holding it. 
the knee looks a lot better. 
i think the grey foot is a little weird, are the different colors or are you trying to show that ones behidn the other. 
i would make that entire back leg that darker green color and the front leg the lighter green color with no outlines. 
yeah. 
np np. 
send it?. 
i cant tell whichi leg is the fron tand which is the back. 
is that the point?. 
yeah. 
that looks better. 
wym. 
i was recreating it to see what i think would look nice and i dont think the legs look that bad w/o the outlines, i changed up the body proportions and made the head a little less wide, but obviously this changes the appearance pretty significantly,
also id add a hilt to the dagger to make it more dagger like. 
colors are different because i was lazy. 
but id make the difference between the shoe of the front foot and the back foot maybe a little more subtle. 
and also general advice is try to limit your colors, i tend to limit it too much, but limiting colors can help the game feel more cohesive and textures less all over the place. 
i need to stop saying godspeed i say it every other sentence. 
one of the all time texts from my dad. 
PIXEL JUMP SCALE. 
SCARE. 
maybe leg should bend a little more when it goes back, but it looks pretty good. 
WAH!. 
looks good. 
hm notion isnt super difficult actually, thats good. 
the issue is there is! a bass solo in the middle of it. 
unfortunately so. 
but mostly because my class necessitates it. 
KITTY EARRINGS. 
HELLO KITTY. 
😔✌️ understandable. 
me when i build a shelter for my chickens?. 
YIPEEEEE happy two of the them tuesday. 
ah stardew. 
i have a friend who is on it so often and makes me wanna play it sooo bad. 
hai, im good, tired, busy, sleepy, but its been fun. 
tomorrow im going to the Big Game and hopefully ill get to see my friend who i havent seen since 3rd grade cause he's in the band for the opposing team. 
how are you. 
football game, UF v tennessee. 
YIPPEEE. 
other projec ts?. 
also ive started working on the battle UI and the final boss, i feel like it came out pretty well. 
?. 
ty!. 
i actually have no idea what youre talking about though. 
also can you tell what they’re fighting. 
in what way. 
the defends kinda weird ik i just couldn’t think of what else to put. 
generic rpg moves. 
ougggh i gotta figure out how to make the sprite look clearer while keeping the scary monster dark. 
something about horror and leaving it to the imagination being scarier. 
hmmm i mean, the fighting system is gonna be pretty bare bones. 
but i feel like defend. 
okay so fight opens up a menu to select your attack
item opens your inventory
but defend would end your turn right there, that’s confusing and annoying. 
defend would be better off just being a move imo. 
maybe there shouldn’t be different moves, i don’t see much of a reason for there to be (at least in the version i make for class). 
good question, haven’t thought of it. 
i’m too eepy to think. 
i’m gonna go to bed, good night!!!. 
OH wait. 
i just wanted to brag. 
:O. 
CAT EARRINGS.

well.

so fair. 
the inventory itself is fine but the UI is terrifying. 
it will break my bones. 
sigh.

the code that is written but has never been run.

no no, i did this to myself (double major) but im not keen on graduating next year (i am double majoring in order to not graduate in 3 years). 
well i have 3 exams a semester and a final. 
thats pretty standard. 
so 2 classes -> 3 exams a semester
1 class -> 2 exams a semester
2 classes -> no exams. 
your brain is so business rotted. 
3 exams + a final!. 
3 exams is pretty standard. 
oh my god. 
i did not want to. 
i want two majors :). 
its not hubris if i simply get good!. 
???. 
oh my god. 
oh my god????????.

I BOUGHT BALDURS GATE 3 HAVE I MENTIONED THAT. 
i wouldve just been playing baldurs gate rn. 
okay well. 
so. 
we dont typically.... fence at practice.... 
we just do drills. 
also its not legal, so you would have to pretend to be a UF student. 
we only fence on fridays. 
yeah tahts basically it. 
like. 
bout. 
s. 
yk. 
i mean sometimes we free fence on not fridays. 
but not always. 
30 minutes of footwork and stretching roughly? depending on the day. 
sigh. 
halfway done with this assignment T-T. 
once we spent all of practice on the same fucking drill, 40 minutes, of the same drill. 
that was a 1 hour practice day. 
footwork and drills, ngl i’m not sure actually going to fencing practice is a good idea cause there’s a high likely hood of getting caught cause you will have fencing equipment(?) and will have to buy a pass to get in. 
there’s a fencing club down town if you really want tho, never been cause it’s scary. 
no i was just gonna a skip today. 
LMAO. 
okay okay. 
drive dangerously. 
also i live on university street good luck finding parking i do not know where it can be found o7.

number 1 pathway to robot revolution i think. 
in general. 
as it stands right now though, ai code sucks pretty bad, i cant see it being practical. 
it cant even write interesting stories. 
new icon!!! cute. 
i don’t know. 
i think my line is if the final product will be different if a person does it than if AI does it AI should not do it. 
hard line. 
not ethics based just “it sucks the soul out of everything so i don’t care, if a final product will be different if done by AI don’t”. 
haiiiii i did. 
sorry super lots of work OTZ. 
its done now though!. 
im so sad about the crab............ 
alas! we live and learn. 
how was your weekend?. 
cute! a little crooked, id make the left side of the hat 1 2 1 instead of 1 1 2 probably,
and the lines some places but not others is a bit strange,
legs too thin, neck too wide, 
it's not giving oversized its giving not proportional. 
i love that art style. 
so clean yet still looks full and detailed. 
left side coming up from the brim. 
you can make it a darker color than the inside of the body but lighter than the full ines. 
also, the shade variance on the skin and hat look messy. 
they dont seem intentional. 
also the slight bit of shading on the bottom of the sweater is too subtle. 
legs should be roughly the length of your torso and head. 
chibi proportions are typically shorter, id still shorten the torso. 
sorry :(. 
i can hold back a little im not sure how much critque you actually want. 
for chibi proportions, the head should be much larger than the body generally, so realistic height probably wont work. 
MAOAMOAMOAMAOMOA. 
that makes sense. 
goodnight!!. 
kibbty. 
much better. 
the arms are still so bulky though. 
the sweater would clump around the bottoms not the middle, but i like the addition of the hands. 
10/10 fantastic. 
hi!!!! yippeee!!!!!!! done with midterms!!!!!!!!!. 
oh no :(. 
do you want any feedback on this one or no. 
its cute!. 
the shoulders a bit too stiff, id make the curve softer. 
good :) I WON A CLAW MACHINE GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 
I KNOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 
its sending. 
. 
:(. 
egg hater. 
they do not. 
you’ll never believe what i’m eating rn. 
egg :). 
nooooooo :( im sorry but i cant apologize for my egg loving tedencies. 
id eat adult chickens too. 
fuck them kids. 
on a call :(. 
sorry :( ive had like absolutely no time the past week. 
oooooo. 
is it incomplete?. 
i like it, it looks a bit like a robotic march though. 
the arm movement is very good, and the proportions are nice. 
you do a good job at conveying the long sleeves here. 
if shes skipping both legs should be off the ground at some pint. 
it should be animated so that the foot slides and the body stays in place i believe. 
?. 
why two pixels. 
why do you have to cut off her leg. 
oh i didnt get that. 
idk, see how it looks, but if youre trying to make it look like its skipping, it has to be off the ground. 
otherwise it looks like a weird march. 
also theres not enough distinction between the back leg and the front leg, cant tell which is which without paying close attention. 
mm. 
i love pixel art. 
thats so fun. 
im going home for friday saturday and then im not sure sunday, i might be working i might be free.

like are we just going to go outside somewhere, backyard i suppose?. 
have never been to a fencing club, no clue how it works. 
:D. 
yeah, also i mean technically we could just fence epee since i have two, i am of course, incredibly biased. 
LMAO. 
i fenced a foilist in epee once, scary stuff. 
how long did you fence?. 
woag. 
meet in the middle we fence with sabre rules. 
yeah. 
equidistant from epee and foil though. 
true. 
i recently tried sabre for the first time. 
it’s crazy different. 
total opposite of epee. 
yeah. 
i feel bad for the poor saberist trying to ref a bunch of epeeists trying to fence sabre. 
You Are Not Valid. 
for playing league. 
makes it worse actually. 
it’s also crazy like. 
epee truly goes on for SO long, i get so tired but, sabre is over so quickly so you’re not really. 
getting as tired. 
WOW. 
WRONG OPINION. ACTUALLY. 
in what world. 
NO. 
in WHAT world is foil more fun than epee. 
hmmmm. 
you can get some really weird and creative touches in epee that you cant get with limited target space. 
you can fleche in epee. 
oh wait are those valid in foil. 
idk. 
theyre not in sabre. 
im in a call. 
i know its horror esque, but what do you do in it. 
:(. 
i mean im fine with horror. 
im just hesistant to buy another game on account of. 
my minecraft addiction and my lack of having finished baldurs gate 3. 
i thought we had plans !?!?. 
so whatever we decide on i suppose. 
i have one very predictable suggestion!. 
O.o. 
no it’s the other obvious one. 
yes. 
good! question. 
do places only have open fencing at specific times?. 
oooh. 
hmmm. 
idc.

also where. 
like, just outside. 
?. 
okay. 
idk if it’s gonna be raining like it was this morning cause if the ground is wet yk. 
it’s not forecasted to rain. 
of course :). 
no i’m so prepared the floors at the gym are sometimes so slippery. 
we fence on a basketball court. 
technically we have a club but it’s. 
well it’s new as of this year, and they got kicked out and are moving?. 
they got kicked out because it was under a church and had a kitchen and the church wanted their kitchen back. 
idk i’ve only been there once for a meeting. 
but that’s off campus. 
and most people can’t drive/don’t have a car, so it would kind of suck. 
no the club is separate to where practice is. 
hmmmmm. 
i have plans, i miiight be able to reschedule them. 
i dont really care about not having a strip but being outside kind of sucks. 
0 idea.

SORRY I WAS DRIVING BACK AND THEN I FORGOT LMAO. 
so omori is this little depressed kid, who has not left his house in years, you travel through head space and faraway town 
in head space you've been in the 1. vast forest  2. otherworld  and 3. sweetheart's palace  
in faraway town kel came to your door, you run around and do errands before hero comes to town, and at the end aubrey pushes basil into a lake and hero rescues you and basil and you hero and kel have a sleepover. 
i have a REALLY detailed summary from someone else if you want LMAO. 
no. 
i texted this while i was hanging out with some people, and someone ended up texting one of their friends whos obsessed with omori. 
Sunny awakens from a dream of his 5 old friends, which suddenly ended due to one of  them, named basil, finding a strange photograph and acting very odd. He is hungry, but hesitant to go down the stairs, as he is panicked and sees them as a near endless descent with floating hands and monsters. After learning to calm down, and trying to eat something, he can't keep it down and ends up back in bed. This time, Basil is missing from the head space,  and it becomes the group focus to find him. After getting sidetracked helping Capt. Spaceboy, a strange shadowy figure leads Omori to a barn, and jolts him awake.. 
In the morning, he hears a knock at the door. Answering it, he finds his friend Kel, looking way taller than he did in Sunnys dream. Kel was a bit shocked, and didn't have a plan for them. Quick to think on his feet, he makes a plan for them. They go to the town's park, only to find a mix of both familiar and unfamiliar faces. Aubrey, with her own group of friends  appears to be bullying Basil. Aubrey is surprised to see sunny, poking fun at him for having not left his house in 4 years. Having spent most of those 4 years dreaming of fighting big bosses with his friends, and his knife, Sunny responded the only way he knew how.. 
After reality sets in, and Aubrey recovers from her stab wounds, she swears revenge and bikes off with her gang. After taking to Basil to his house, he reveals Aubrey took his photo album. After looking across town, and fighting most of Aubrey's gang, they find her at church, mid sermon.  They sit behind her, and start a quiet argument. During this argument, it's revealed that Mari, Sunny's dear sister, had died.. 
The argument spirals out of control, and Aubrey confronts both Kel and Sunny physically, with her bat. After a brief scuffle, the whispering of the distrubed churchgoers causes Aubrey to bolt out. When the boys start heading down the street, they catch Aubrey throwing something away, and walking back in her house. Kel digs through the trash to find the missing album. After bringing it back to Basils house, they are invited in for dinner. Basil then learns of Sunnys moving coming in 3 days, and moves to the bathroom to have a panic attack, and the boys see thier way out. Kel walks Sunny home, and he heads to bed.
After having another adventure in headspace, Sunny awakens the morning after to Kel knocking on his door. Hero will be in town today, and Kel wants to pick up some orders from a bakery and a pizza place with Sunny. After delivering the orders to Kel's home, Basil's caretaker knocks on the door and asks if they have seen him. Sunny and Kel then dart out to the park where they last found him, and hear him screaming from their old hangout spot. After making their way through the trees, they find Aubrey and her gang trying to push Basil away from their secret spot. After a scuffle against the 6 of them that solves nothing, Kel tries to talk with Aubrey to calm her down, which only makes her angrier. This ends with the gang getting uncomfortable and leaving. Basil tries to comfort Aubrey, but she pushes him into a nearby lake. Sunny dives in after him, but is terrified of drowning, and so ends up getting stuck underwater with him. Hero had come by looking for them, and dives in to save them both. Both Basil and Sunny are okay, but Basil needs to be rushed somewhere warm. Hero does not recognize Aubrey, as she has changed greatly since last they had seen each other.. 
After delivering Basil to his house, The boys decide to make good use of Sunnys limited time, and have one last sleepover at his house. 
When Sunny falls asleep for his usual adventure, this time a fog encompasses the entire head space, and everyone is missing but Mari. She helps Omori conquer his fear of drowning, and takes him on a swim to some docks. While walking, Mari tells Omori of how proud she is of him, but mentions how there's something big he is forgetting. Once they reach the end of the docks, there is a large curtain suspended over the water. Mari looks deep into Omori, and expresses how she hopes Sunny is still in there, somewhere, before turning ghostly and wishing her brother goodbye. She floats into the curtained window, and disappears. Omori then has a panic attack, and when he blinks, opens his eyes to find himself at the foot of a deep well, with a ladder. After climbing down it, he finds himself in an underwater highway. Taking a taxi, he finds Kel, who says that all their friends have gotten stuck in contracts, and he needs Omori's help to get them out. Approaching the last resort, they find Mari, who comments that Omori seems bothered, as if he had seen a ghost.. 
i have no idea who this guy is but he wrote so much. 
the well is like, at the end of the water. 
OH MY GOD I FINALLY FOUND IT. 
YOU KNOW HOW I SAID AT THE BACKSEAT LOVERS CONCERT SOMEONE SHOUTED HEY AT THE SAME TIME THEY SAID HEY IN THE SONG AND IT WAS A WHOLE THING.
